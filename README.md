WaveRNN is an implementation, that provides faster way to synthesise neural audio by providing rudimentary improvements.

this implementation will provide support in the following pattern

- [ ] Basic implementation, which improves net algorithmic efficiency
- [ ] Providing support for faster future prediction
- [ ] Providing support for sparse pruning
- [ ] Training with support for mel inputs, thus can be used as faster alternative for tacotron-2
