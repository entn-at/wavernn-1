WaveRNN is an implementation, that provides faster way to synthesise neural audio by providing rudimentary improvements.

this implementation will provide support in the following pattern

    1. Basic implementation, which improves net algorithmic efficiency
    2. Providing support for faster future prediction
    3. Providing support for sparse pruning
    4. Training with support for mel inputs, thus can be used as faster alternative for tacotron-2
