This is the root file for the implementation of wavernn

this implementation will provide support in the following pattern

    1. Basic implementation, which improves net algorithmic efficiency
    2. Providing support for faster future prediction
    3. Providing support for sparse pruning
    4. Training with support for mel inputs, thus can be used as faster alternative for tacotron-2
